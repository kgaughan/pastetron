Overview
========

*pastetron* is a very simple pastebin_ application. It supports syntax
highlighting, comments, and has a feed of recently posted pastes.

It (currently) has no build-in authentication or CSRF prevention support, so
is only intended for private use or use within an organisation.

Running with Paste
==================

Pastetron exposes a WSGI application factory for use with Paste_. You can
refer to it with ``egg:pastetron`` like so::

    [app:pastetron]
    use = egg:pastetron

Running with a standard WSGI server
===================================

The ``pastetron.wsgi`` module exposes the WSGI application as ``app``.

To run it using uwsgi_::

    $ uwsgi --master --http localhost:8000 -w pastetron.wsgi:app

To urn it using waitress_::

    $ waitress-serve pastetron.wsgi:app

To specify the configuration file path, assign it to the environment variable
``PASTETRON_CONFIG``. The configuration file is an INI file with a single
section, ``pastetron``. Example::

    [pastetron]
    db_path=/var/db/pastetron.sqlite
    site_name=My Pastes
