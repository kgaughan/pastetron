Overview
========

*pastetron* is a very simple pastebin_ application. It supports syntax
highlighting, comments, and has a feed of recently posted pastes.

It (currently) has no build-in authentication or CSRF prevention support, so
is only intended for private use or use within an organisation.

Pastetron exposes a WSGI application factory for use with Paste_. You can
refer to it with ``egg:pastetron`` like so::
